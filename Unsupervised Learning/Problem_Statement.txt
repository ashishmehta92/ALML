QUESTION 2: 

• DOMAIN: Automobile
• CONTEXT: The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The
vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.
• DATA DESCRIPTION: The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles in different angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles were
used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of vehicles
was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to
distinguish between the cars.
• All the features are numeric i.e. geometric features extracted from the silhouette.
• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Apply dimensionality reduction technique – PCA and train a model and compare relative results.

A. Read ‘vehicle.csv’ and save as DataFrame. [1 Marks]
B. Check percentage of missing values and impute with correct approach. [1 Marks]
C. Visualize a Pie-chart and print percentage of values for variable ‘class’. [2 Marks]
